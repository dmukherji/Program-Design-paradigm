These are the files that you have to commit to SVN for the homework:

1.rkt
2.rkt
3.rkt
notebook.txt
a
Use the notebook as discussed in the lecture and on the course homepage,
and use the .rkt-files for the three problems of the problem set.

For this and for all coming homeworks, keep the naming scheme as it is:
setXX/N.rkt

You'll have to create future homework directories and Racket files
yourself. Read the instructions of a problem set carefully, as there
may be additional requirements in the future (like additional files).

If you have any further questions, refer to the course homepage
and/or the discussion boards. Good Luck!
